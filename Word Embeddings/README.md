# Word Embeddings

## Objective:
implement two classifiers for the Movie Reviews (IMBD) dataset that use word embeddings, along the lines shown in [Section 6.1](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/6.1-using-word-embeddings.ipynb). The first classifier should learn the word embeddings from the data; the second should use pretrained word embeddings constructed in some other way (either [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)).
