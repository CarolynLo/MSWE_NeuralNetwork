# Advanced Use of RNNs

## Objective:
Implement two classifers for the Jena climate dataset through advanced use of Recurrent Neural Networks, along the lines of [Section 6.3](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/6.3-advanced-usage-of-recurrent-neural-networks.ipynb). Pick two out of the three advanced techniques described in the textbook: recurrent dropout, stacking RNN layers, and bidirectional RNN layers.
