# RNNs

## Objective:
Implement two classifers for the Movie Reviews dataset with Recurrent Neural Networks, along the lines of [Section 6.2](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/6.2-understanding-recurrent-neural-networks.ipynb). The first classifier should use the SimplRNN layer, and the second should use an LSTM layer.
