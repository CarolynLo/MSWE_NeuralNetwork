# Cats vs. Dogs, Small Dataset

## Objective:
Implement a classifier that can distinguish cats from dogs, along the lines of the one given in  the Cats and Dogs with small dataset (https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/5.2-using-convnets-with-small-datasets.ipynb) example in Chapter 5 of the textbook. Your classifier should use data augmentation to avoid overfitting. Your program should end by plotting the charts for validation accuracy and validation loss and outputting the accuracy on the test data.
