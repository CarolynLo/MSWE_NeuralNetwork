# Sequence Processing with ConvNets

## Objective:
Implement two classifers for the Movie Reviews dataset with 1D Convolutional Neural Networks, along the lines of [Section 6.4](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/6.4-sequence-processing-with-convnets.ipynb). The first classifier should use simple Conv1D layers; the second should use a combination of CNN and RNN layers.
