# Cats vs. Dogs, Pretrained

Objective: Implement a classifier that can distinguish between cats and dogs, along the lines of [the Cats and Dogs with pretrained model](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/first_edition/5.3-using-a-pretrained-convnet.ipynb) example given in Chapter 5 of the textbook. You can use either the technique of fast feature extraction, or the technique of fine tuning. (Keep in mind that you will be quizzed on both techniques). Your program should end by plotting the charts for validation accuracy and validation loss, and outputting the accuracy on the test data.
